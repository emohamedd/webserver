## Socket
A __socket__ is an endpoint in a network communication. You can think of it as a virtual device that allows computers to communicate with each other. It's like a virtual plug and socket system.

Let's use a real-world analogy to explain this:

Imagine you're trying to send a letter (data) to a friend. You need two things: your friend's address (IP address) and a mailbox (port) to drop the letter in. In this analogy, the combination of the address and the mailbox is like a socket.
